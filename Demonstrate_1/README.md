Data Story - Appliance Energy Consumption
Problem:
With the rising electricity bills in Australia, more and more consumers are opting for more energy-efficient TVs. However, there are many TV brands and types in the market, and consumers are unclear about which high-efficiency products to choose, which could affect their purchasing decisions.

Data Support Question:
By analyzing data such as TV brands (Brand_Reg), screen technology (Screen_Tech), screen size (screensize), and annual energy consumption (Labelled energy consumption), we can identify which TV brands and technologies are more advantageous in terms of energy saving.

Solution:
Consumers are advised to choose energy-efficient TVs by understanding the energy performance of different brands and screen technologies.

Goal:
The goal is to identify the most energy-efficient TV brands and screen technologies by analyzing the annual energy consumption data under different brands (Brand_Reg) and screen technologies (Screen_Tech), helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

Methods:
Bar charts and scatter plots were used to compare the energy consumption of TVs from different brands and technologies, displaying the energy efficiency of different brands and screen technologies.

Verification Effects:
Brand Energy Efficiency Comparison: The bar chart shows the annual energy consumption of different brands, helping identify the most energy-efficient brands.

Screen Technology Comparison: The scatter plot shows the annual energy performance of different screen technologies.

Screen Size vs. Energy Consumption: This shows the relationship between screen size and annual energy consumption of the TV.

Conclusion:
Energy-efficient Brands: Some brands like ARK and LSP TVs have lower annual energy consumption.

Recommended Screen Technology: The data shows that OLED screens have lower energy consumption when the screen size is the same.

Screen Size Impact: The larger the size, the greater the energy consumption.

Recommendation: Consumers, when meeting their needs, should opt for smaller-sized TVs and preferably choose OLED or LED screens to save on electricity costs.
