Data Story - Appliance Energy Consumption
Problem:
As electricity bills rise in Australia, more consumers are choosing energy-efficient TVs. However, with many brands and types available, consumers are unclear about which products are most energy-efficient, affecting their purchase decisions.

Data Support:
By analyzing data on TV brands (Brand_Reg), screen technologies (Screen_Tech), screen sizes (screensize), and annual energy consumption (Labelled energy consumption), we can identify the most energy-efficient options.

Solution:
Consumers are advised to choose energy-efficient TVs by understanding the energy performance of different brands and technologies.

Goal:
Identify the most energy-efficient TV brands and technologies, helping consumers make informed decisions.

Methods:
Bar charts and scatter plots were used to compare the energy consumption of different brands and technologies.

Results:
Brand Comparison: The bar chart shows the annual energy consumption of different brands.

Technology Comparison: A scatter plot compares the energy efficiency of different screen technologies.

Screen Size vs. Energy Consumption: The relationship between screen size and energy consumption is shown.

Conclusion:
Energy-efficient Brands: ARK and LSP TVs have lower energy consumption.

Recommended Technology: OLED screens are more energy-efficient for the same size.

Screen Size Impact: Larger sizes consume more energy.

Advice: Consumers should choose smaller TVs and prefer OLED or LED screens to save on electricity.




About the Data
Data Source:
The dataset contains energy consumption data for various TV brands and models in the Australian market, including brand (Brand_Reg), screen technology (Screen_Tech), screen size (screensize), and annual energy consumption (Labelled energy consumption).

Data Processing:
The data was cleaned and normalized to ensure accuracy, removing incomplete or outlier values and standardizing formats.

Privacy:
The dataset does not contain any personal information, so there are no privacy concerns.

Accuracy and Limitations:
The dataset's accuracy depends on the update cycle of market data for TV brands. There may be discrepancies in energy consumption data for different brands and models, so this analysis is for reference only.

Ethics:
The data is used for non-commercial analysis and is sourced from public records, ensuring compliance.
